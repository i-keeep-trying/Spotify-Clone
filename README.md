# Spotify-Clone
This is a clone of the spotify website.
This website has been made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It can play 5 songs. The songs can be changed using the previous button and the next button, and the song can also be paused/played using the play-pause button. The volume bar and the progress bar are also functional, so we can play a particular part of the song and its volume can also be changed easily. Its search button is also functional. When it is pressed, a search bar appears. However, you will not be able to actually search any song with it as I don't have such a large music database. You can also like a song. When the heart button is clicked, the hollow heart changes to solid heart similar to what happens in spotify. When the songs are changed or when play/pause button is pressed, sometimes it is taking a few seconds for the icons/images to get changed when using the github link to view the website, but that's probably because of some network issue. When I run the website locally in my laptop, it runs smoothly.
