# Spotify-Clone
This is a clone of the spotify website for KodeinKGP task round.
This website has been made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It can play 5 songs. The songs can be changed using the previous button and the next button, and the song can also be paused/played using the play-pause button. The volume bar and the progress bar are also functional, so we can play a particular part of the song and its volume can also be changed easily. Its search button is also functional. When it is pressed, a search bar appears. However, you will not be able to actually search any song with it as I don't have such a large music database. You can also like a song. When the heart button is clicked, the hollow heart chaanges to solid heart similar to what happens in spotify.
